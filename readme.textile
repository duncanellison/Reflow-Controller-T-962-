Reflow-Controller

PC Based software controller for T962 series reflow ovens

This software is offered as-is and without any support or warranty.

It was written using licensable .net extension components which will not compile properly unless you obtain a licence from DevComponents (https://www.devcomponents.com/dotnetbar/). You may choose to edit these controls out or simply rewite the application using this as a guide.

Either way, please don't ask for help as I'm not in a position at the moment to assist.
